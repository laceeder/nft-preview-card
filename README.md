## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Learned how to use the hover selector and how to style it.

### Continued development

I would like to further explore what I can do with the hover selector. Also would need to explore how to use SASS. I did not use it in this challenge because I have never used it before.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_hover.asp) - This helped me play around with the various ways I used the hover selector and try different things out.

## Acknowledgments

I saw [@Bayoumi-dev] on Frontend Mentor explain to another user how to use the hover selector and what stylings they needed in their solution. Reading through their explanation also helped me understand the hover property a lot better and how I would need to style it in CSS and why! Very helpful!
